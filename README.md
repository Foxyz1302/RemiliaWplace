## What You'll Need

First things first, you need a magic extension for your browser that runs scripts.

*   **Tampermonkey** ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) | [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) | [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd)) - *The popular choice*
*   **Violentmonkey** ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag) | [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/) | [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/violentmonkey/eeagobfjdenkkddmbclomhiblgggliao)) - *Also works great*

Pick one and install it. Then come back here!

## Let's Get Set Up! (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Get the Main Overlay Script
Our config is useless without the main engine! We need the "Wplace Overlay Pro" script.

1.  **Click this link:** https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/545041-wplace-overlay-pro
2.  On the GreasyFork page, click the big green **"Install this script"** button.
3.  It will open your userscript manager (Tampermonkey/Violentmonkey). Click **Install** again.
4.  Refresh the Wplace page. You should see a new "Overlay PRO" button somewhere on the screen. Congrats!

### Step 2: Load Our Sweet Takorin Template
Now for the main event: importing our art.

1.  **Grab the JSON files from this repo:**
    *   Click on `Remilia 1.json` and `Remilia 2.json` in the file list above.
    *   Click the "Raw" button.
    *   Right-click on the page that opens and select **Save Page As...** to save it to your computer. Make sure it saves as a `.json` file!

2.  **Open the Overlay PRO menu** on the Wplace page.

3.  **Import `Remilia 1.json` and `Remilia 2.json`:**
    *   Go to the **Ovelays** section.
    *   Click **Import**.
    *   Click **Choose File** and find the `overlay.json` you just saved.
    *   Now you should have the overlay on the canvas.
  
### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTICE: READ BEFORE PAINTING!
> * Before painting, to make sure you're painting the right colors, In the **Mode** section select Mini-pixel. This will make it so that when you use the eyedropper tool, it will select the right color.
> 
> * You may see the color wrong, therefore there's a "Style" in the **Mode** section called symbols which will display different symbols for every color, so you could make sure you're painting the right color (But it can be laggy for some).
>
> * If you don't have the color don't make more work by painting in "the closest color", always make sure you're using the right color
> 
> * Our artwork is positioned to coexist with others. Before you start placing pixels, **please double-check the overlay against the current canvas** to ensure we are building in the correct location and not accidentally overwriting a neighbor's existing art.

## Shoutouts & Tools üõ†Ô∏è

A massive thanks to the creator of the **Wplace Overlay Pro** script itself! You can find it here:

This overlay was also made with the help of an awesome color converter tool. If you ever want to make your own, check it out:

## Tips

*   **Focus on the outline and details first!** Get the main shape down before worrying about fine details.
